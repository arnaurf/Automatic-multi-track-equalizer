# multitrack_eq

These are the files from my Bachelor Thesis at Pompeu Fabra University. Based on the paper "Autonomous Multitrack Equalization Based on
Masking Reduction" by Sina Hafezi and Joshua D. Reiss. 

There's the offline version made with Matlab and an online version (VST) made with JUCE and C++.
